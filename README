== What is Cloud Foundry?

Cloud Foundry is an open platform-as-a-service (PaaS). The system supports
multiple frameworks, multiple application infrastructure services and
deployment to multiple clouds.

== What is this component?

This repo contains the sample BOSH package and release for a sample Cloud Foundry service:
echo service (https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap-services/tree/master/echo)
the section below will walk you through how to deploy echo service into Cloud Foundry

== How to deploy echo service with BOSH package and release?

1. git clone cf-release repo (https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release)
2. git clone vcap-services-sample-release repo (https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap-services-sample-release)
3. cp -r vcap-services-sample-release/jobs/* cf-release/jobs/
   cp -r vcap-services-sample-release/packages/* cf-release/packages/
4. append the content of vcap-services-sample-release/config/blobs_echo.yml to cf-release/config/blobs.yml
5. add 'echo' into 'builtin_services' section of cloud controller configuration file - see https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/blob/master/jobs/cloud_controller/templates/cloud_controller.yml.erb#L161 . An simpler alternative way to achieve this is for CC to get the token from external_service_tokens - see https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/blob/master/jobs/cloud_controller/templates/cloud_controller.yml.erb#L174-L179. Add 'external_service_tokens' under 'properties' section like this: https://github.com/vmware-ac/deployments/blob/master/dev-template-services-ng.erb#L1967-L1968 .
6. bosh create release and then bosh upload release
7. in your BOSH deployment manifest, add below section under 'jobs', for example insert into https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/bosh/samples/cloudfoundry.yml#L294

    - name: echo_node
      template: echo_node
      instances: 1
      resource_pool: infrastructure
      persistent_disk: 128
      networks:
      - name: default
        static_ips:
        - 192.0.2.90

    - name: echo_gateway
      template: echo_gateway
      instances: 1
      resource_pool: infrastructure
      networks:
      - name: default

   and add gateway token under 'properties', for example insert into https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/bosh/samples/cloudfoundry.yml#L632

    echo_gateway:
      token: changeechotoken
      service_timeout: 15
      node_timeout: 10
    echoserver:
      port: 5002

   and change resource pool size if necessary, see https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/bosh/samples/cloudfoundry.yml#L55

8. bosh deploy
